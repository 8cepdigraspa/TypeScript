Pokemon Battle Revolution is a Wii game that allows you to battle with your own Pokemon or use rental Pokemon in various colosseums. However, if you want to have all 493 Pokemon available in the game, you will need to transfer them from your DS Pokemon games using a wireless connection. Alternatively, you can also use a modded Wii and a save file manager to import a save file that has all the Pokemon already transferred.
